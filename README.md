<h2> User Stories and Feature Tasks</h2>
<h3>User Stories (MVP)<h3>
<ul>
<li>As a user, I want a webpage that displays individual store data for my Salmon Cookie Shops, so that I can be informed about how to run my business</li>
<li>As a developer, I want to represent the store data in a list format on the webpage, so my client can view the information</li>
<li>As a developer, I want to use object-oriented programming to build this site, so that the site will be more effective and the code will be easier to read and understand</li>
</ul>
<h3>Technical Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>New repository properly set up with a license and README, and cloned to local machine</li>
<li>Working on a non-master branch, with regular commit history</li>
<li>Good use of Object Literals (no constructors allowed today); one for each store model; properties/values and methods are correctly constructed and given meaningful names</li>
<li>Main page meets requirements of the problem domain</li>
<li>Use template literals in your JS logic to render the stores as lists on the sales page</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li>As a developer, I want to make some headway on the public-facing page for the business by generating a low-fidelity wireframe of what I want the page to look like.</li>
</ul>
